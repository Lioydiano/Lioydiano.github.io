# Contributing
Here you can find the contributing guidelines.


# Teams
The way of contributing depends on which [`team`](https://github.com/orgs/Lioydiano/teams) you belong to.

## Journalist
The `journalists` are those ones who are supposed to create `.txt` or `.md` files with the content of new articles.

## Formatter
The `formatters` are those ones who are supposed to take the content of the articles from text files and format them into `.html` files.

They can contribute in a few ways:
- Opening an [`issue`](https://github.com/orgs/Lioydiano/issues) asking to developers some improvements to the source files
- Opening an [`issue`](https://github.com/orgs/Lioydiano/issues) asking to journalists about the formatting of the articles
- Copying the content of `.txt` and `.md` articles in order to format them into `.html` as soon as possible

## Developer
The `developers` are those ones who are supposed to improve the site style and functionalities editing the `.js`, `.css` and `.html` files.
